This is a simple web application to demonstrate the K-Means clustering algorithm, which is used for clustering data into groups based on similarity

# Features
* Data generation: Users can directly draw their own dataset on the canvas, or choose from predefined datasets.
* Customization: Users can specify the number of clusters (K).

# Tehnologies used
* Vanilla HTML, CSS for structure
* Typescript for interactive functionality and algorithm implementation
* Canvas API for drawing and visualizing the data
